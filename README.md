# Todo-App-React

### Motivation
By using the classic todo app as a way of learning a new language, I aim to learn how to test-drive a project in [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). 

#### Why learn React?
1. One of my learning goals is to learn how to TDD in a new language - although React is not strictly a language, but rather a language, it is different enough from JS that it constitutes learning a new language for the purposes of meeting my goals. 
2. React has a plethora of applications, including web applications, native mobile apps, command line interfaces, avionics and much more. 
3. React is capable of building any complex UI keeping state out of the DOM. React employs a Virtual DOM that ensures maximum efficiency by only re-rendering nodes whenever it is required.
4. It frequently features on job specs, indicating its wide-spead adoption.

### Process for Learning
1. Read the documentation for React and complete the tutorials to grasp the fundamentals of the library and learn any style/naming/project structure conventions.
2. [Spike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wLEwj6mOrE&t=518s) the Todo app, following the guidance on the youtube video of the head coach at Makers, Ed Withers, to get a sense of how the app will be structured.
3. Research revealed the most-loved testing library for React to be enzyme, developed by AirBnB. Facebook's endorsement of enzyme and its recommendation of enzyme's use over React's inbuilt testing library, Jest, is good reason for choosing enzyme (and a likely indicator that enzyme is used in industry). 
4. Test drive the Todo app
